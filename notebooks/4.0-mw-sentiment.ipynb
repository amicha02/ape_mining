       "  'Since bursting onto the scene in 2021, non-fungible tokens have opened up a new avenue for sports companies to engage with their fans. Few months ago BlackBook Motorsport caught up with executives at Formula One and Speedway Motorsports to hear how those within the motorsport industry are navigating the evolving NFT landscape.\\n\\nJust as the likes of basketball, soccer and cricket have started to make their move, Formula1 has also been making early forays into the digital collectibles space as part of the industry’s initial embrace of blockchain technology as a means of creating new partnerships and modernizing fan engagement. The most reasonable approach for this to work out is to mint Formula1 themed NFTs.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v67f8fnbogy81.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3430175b006c5bd7f814cdd151cc63932aa271c1\\n\\nAn NFT is a unique digital certificate of ownership, stored on the blockchain, and can come in the form of photos, videos and audio, which fans are able to buy, collect and trade. This might sound familiar, and that’s largely because it is. Collecting and trading has long been a popular way for fans to express their passion for racing sport with physical products, whether it be through assembling a collection of miniature racing cars or filling up sticker albums and collecting rare event tickets. NFTs are seen as a way of essentially bringing that tradition into the digital realm.\\n\\nThat, it seems, is now the aim of  William Racing partnering with Terra Virtua. According to Williams Racing Commercial Director James Bower he said; “Collaborating with Terra Virtua presents an opportunity to engage with the race fans of the future in an entirely new way. He went on to say “our interest in this space is about fans,” he explains. “It’s about a new way of opening up fans engaging in sport and trying to attract a different audience.”\\n\\n[A Typical Terra Virtua Racing Car from an Augmented Reality view!](https://preview.redd.it/4sl7m2xjogy81.jpg?width=803&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=397d60c39920686f0a7cb4d5eb51f0e4d0868e34)\\n\\nSeeing that Terra Virtua, the digital market place backing this partnership has released NFTs for different notable brands after similar partnerships, What this means is that a William Racing licensed NFT is well in the works. Details about number of mint, Rarity levels are not yet available but i am sure the NFTs will be augmented reality enabled and reward for completing the Williams Racing collection.'),\n",

The live events sector is one of the industries that might be completely disrupted by NFTs. To improve live events, ticketing companies and concert producers should keep an eye on evolving technology.  \\n\\n\\nAside from some basic aspects such as ease of use, especially if you find a scalable platform such as NFT TiX in my case, I believe that those of you interested in this topic have already discovered what works best for you.   \\n\\n\\nWhat I mean when I say I love NFT ticketing is about all the numerous benefits. NFTs for ticketing add transparency to the ticketing platform and ensure secondary buyers receive a valid ticket to the event.  \\n\\n\\nAs a user, you can receive perks and incentives from event organizers, sell tickets for upcoming events that you cannot attend, sell rare past tickets that other people would like to collect, safely store tickets to keep memories alive, engage and be a part of event organizer's communities, and so on. But don't forget that there are several benefits for event organizers as well.  \\n\\n\\nSo, what's your opinion, do you support these types of tickets or you're an old school?\"),\n",

This is an area where NFT technology can offer wide practical use that most individuals in society can benefit from.\\n\\nInstead of leaving the recording, management and tracking of an individual's medical history to large healthcare institutions , a single NFT ledger assigned to each person can store all medical information while maintaining confidentiality and privacy .\\n\\nThis would also allow an individual to control what information is shared with a healthcare provider when seeking treatment, while keeping less relevant personal data private.\\n\\nOne day this process may begin at birth with the issuance of an NFT birth certificate to newborns by a health care provider or government agency. This may also be the beginning of the establishment of a traceable digital identification registry in the form of NFTs.\\n\\nWith digital forms of ID, people will be able to limit what information is shared when identifying information is required, such as an app that will verify if a person is over 21 without also revealing other information often included in IDs, such as the home address.\\n\\n## Tokenization of real estate and assets\\n\\nThe tokenization of real estate and other real-world assets is perhaps one of the broadest and most paradigm-shifting applications of NFT technology due to the implications it has across numerous sectors.\\n\\nIn addition to being an easy way to track and verify ownership of an item, tokenizing assets will eventually allow them to be used in many of the various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\\n\\nOver time, individuals will be able to use the NFTs that represent the deed to their home as collateral in a DeFi protocol that will allow them to borrow funds for use elsewhere in a similar way to refinancing.\\n\\nTokenizing larger items, such as a hotel or luxury yacht, also allows for fractional ownership, giving those who might not normally be able to afford such an item a way to gain exposure to it.\\n\\nThere is no limit to what can be tokenized and tracked on a blockchain, and there is a good chance that all kinds of assets, including stocks, bonds, works of art, rare collectibles and luxury items, will one day be represented in the form of NFTs.\\n\\n## Intellectual property and patents\\n\\nNFTs are ideal for tracking intellectual property (IP) and patents as they take the current trademark and copyright system to the next level, offering a way to prove ownership of any piece of content.\\n\\nThe data-preserving ability of blockchain technology allows the entire history of a piece of IP to be traced and time-stamped, offering a way to provide undeniable ownership. Similarly, data from a patent or invention can be recorded on a blockchain in the form of NFTs, offering a way to protect and certify ownership.\\n\\n## Ticketing and Rewards Programs\\n\\nOne use case for NFTs that is already being explored and implemented in entertainment venues around the world is the creation of event tickets or passes . The ability to create an unlimited number of unique NFTs allows venues such as concert halls and sports stadiums to issue tickets as NFTs that can be easily verified or transferred.\\n\\nThe prevalence of smartphones in society has made digital ticketing possible, and the integration of NFT technology will help make this process more efficient and easier to follow.\\n\\nCompanies can set up rewards programs where participants receive an [NFT development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) that is used to track purchases or activities within the organization for reward purposes. Instead of issuing physical cards or tracking activity through a phone number, which exposes a significant amount of personal information, activities can be tracked through an NFT that is scanned without revealing any other information.\\n\\n## exclusive affiliations\\n\\nA final application of [NFT technology](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) is as a general utility token that performs a specific function, such as verifying membership in an exclusive club or giving access to a certain service.\\n\\nThis is a feature that is already being employed by a number of NFT projects where they have a website group that can only be accessed after verifying ownership of an NFT from that particular collection.\\n\\nApplications of this idea are vast and run the gamut from content creators giving fans exclusive access to songs if they have an NFT released by that musician to secret societies allowing holders of rare NFTs access to their sacred libraries.\"),\n",

       "  'I came up with an idea for a product in the NFT space and would love to hear your feedback on it!  \\n\\n\\nSo personally I have been in the NFT space for almost a year and ran into a couple of problems that bothered me:  \\n\\\\- Some NFTs are too expensive for me, but I would still like to profit from their price development without joining an investment DAO  \\n\\\\- Sometimes I would like to short certain NFT collections, but there is no option to do this  \\n\\n\\nSo I came up with a product idea and would love to hear your opinion on this:  \\n\\n\\nA website that offers Long and Short options for big collections (BAYC, Moonbirds, CloneX, etc.).  \\n\\n\\nHow would I build this?  \\n\\n\\nFrontend: A website that allows me to log in with MetaMask and displays two charts for each sophisticated NFT collection. One chart for Long and another for Short. Each chart changes with the market sentiment.   \\n\\n\\n**For example:** 9 out of 10 people believe that the median collection price for BAYC will rise, then the Long chart is at 1.11 and the Short Chart is at 10. \\n\\nIf the sentiment changes and now 7 out of 10 people believe BAYC will rise, the Long chart is at 1.42 and the Short Chart is at 3.33.  \\n\\n\\nBasically allowing market bets on the future price development of the median collection price of sophisticated NFT collections. It would also be possible to take the floor price as an indicator, however, this creates the option of heavy market manipulation, which is not that desirable.  \\n\\n\\nBackend: The whole financial backbone of this product should be running in a smart contract (for obvious reasons).  \\n\\n\\nThe smart contract would need to do 3 things:  \\n\\\\- Get current market prices for the NFT collections  \\n\\\\- Get the market sentiment  \\n\\\\- Calculate the chart values of these two inputs  \\n\\n\\nGetting the market data is possible with decentralized external adapters powered by Chainlink. (Basically a decentralized API for the smart contract)  \\n\\n\\nGetting the market sentiment is the hardest part. I expect that it would be possible to make an initial market analysis with the community and then afterward let the smart contract regulate the value itself by incoming transactions for either the long or short side.  \\n\\n\\nStructure: A DAO makes the most sense for me.

I’m here to report that this is not the case with this particular platform. Transactions are fast and actually getting to purchase an NFT is a straight-forward process.\\n\\nTo acquire an NFT on Authorzd, you pay for a snapback as the physical product, and then you get a virtual trading card that has a unique QR on its backside. You scan the code to reveal your NFT. I was impressed by the fact that once you scan the QR code and retrieve the NFT, the asset is automatically added to the OpenSea NFT gallery. \\n\\nAnother fact is that the quality of the availed physical products is top-notch. The snapbacks are absolutely beautiful. Authorzd also offers great treats for early entrants. These may be in the form of tip-offs when there are high-potential products to invest in. If you’re one of the early community members, you also get priority treatment during early-stage sales of potentially lucrative digital products.\\n\\nBesides that, the NFT platform has plans to later introduce more off-line assets to back NFTs, and the same rules will apply. For now, 150 Blockhead Buddy NFTs and their corresponding real-world assets will be released, with the buying priority going to the early entrants.\\n\\nFor more about us, visit us on our:\\n\\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/BlockheadBuddyP](https://twitter.com/BlockheadBuddyP) \\n\\nWebsite [https://authorzd.com/](https://authorzd.com/)'),\n",

Would it not be completely legal for a system to be set up for the normal person to buy NFTs, Have a NFT appraisal website and then be able to donate the inflated appraisal NFTs.

This means that you can create a Litecoin NFT.\\n* The Litecoin network is also utilized as a payment method, which means that many cryptocurrency payment processors accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment, which opens up a lot more gateways for creatives to capitalize on their art through it.\\n* LTC is the native cryptocurrency token of the network, and it is a cryptocurrency that can be mined due to the fact that the network utilizes the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism.\\n* Anyone can easily connect to a Litecoin (LTC) node through the utilization of NOWNodes, after which they will be fully able to get any blockchain data that they require.\\xa0\\n\\nLitecoin is one of the oldest, as well as one of the most well-known blockchain networks currently available, which has stood the test of time and is regularly available to develop on.

At OWN(One World Nation) they made learniog about crypto ecosystem very simple and interesting to move forward in crypto world.\\n\\nVision :\\n\\nFor a new user crypto world might be overwhelming, so OWN vision is to create a universe that would introduce newcomers to the crypto ecosystem interactive, gamified, fun and easy to learn way. At OWN they belive that they will cahgne the way about how people will feel about crypto ecosystem. There vsion with the project is \" ONBOARD A BILLION USER INTO CRYPTO VIA GAMIFICATION OF THE CRYPTO ECOSYSTEM! \"\\n\\nMission :\\n\\nCommunity-Led Creation\\n\\nEasy Platform Accessibility\\n\\nSeamless Product Experience\\n\\nCreate a Sustainable Economy\\n\\nNFT :\\n\\nNFTs will form the basis of economic transactions in the Cryptoverse. To ensure the value of the NFTs increase over a period of time, more utilities will be added progressively.\\n\\nWe are building the platform with NFT interoperability in mind. A series of games will come on the platform where the same NFTs can be used. This will increase the overall utility of the NFT.\\n\\nOWN is a crypto verse where people can have fun and earn using there favourite cryptos. To achieve this, OWN has personified real world cryptos into different alien creatures. These crypto creatures are the native species of the crypto verse and are called “Cryptonites”.\\n\\nPost the gamification of the Crypto markets we will gamify the Defi ecosystem. Once the user comes into Crypto markets, transitioning into Defi space is not easy. Therefore, we will gamify the entire Defi ecosystem. We will achieve this by building interesting games around Farming. Therefore, the next set of NFTs will be around Land sales where the user can buy them and set up their own Defi Farms. The user will also be able to monetize his land in various ways.\\n\\nBreeding :\\n\\nLike creatures on Planet Earth, Cryptonites can be bred to create a new offspring in the OWN Cryptoverse. Genesis NFTs will lead the civilisation and give birth to new generations.\\n\\nBreeding in OWN Cryptoverse will cost some Breeding Fees and some Life Gems ($LFG) depending on how many times the Cryptonites have been bred. The Breeding fee is subject to adjustment based on a myriad of economic factors.\\n\\nGameplay :\\n\\nThe OWN Cryptoverse will evolve in 3 distinct phases, in line with the evolution of the Crypto ecosystem. During each phase, players can play interesting games, earn a lot of crypto rewards & learn more about the crypto ecosystem.\\n\\nPhase 1 : Introduction of Cryptos - Proof of Play\\n\\nPhase 2: Gamification of the Crypto Markets\\n\\nPhase 3: Gamification of DeFi\\n\\nTokenomics- $OWNED :\\n\\n$OWNED will be the ERC-20 governance token within One World Nation (OWN). The Cryptoverse will be built by the community, for the community and of course owned by the community. The project will aim to achieve significant decentralisation over the next 3.5 years.\\n\\nOWN’s goal with $OWNED is to create sustainable economy.\\n\\n$OWNED holders will have following benefits :\\n\\nGovernance\\n\\nPlatform Access\\n\\nEarning Opportunities\\n\\nBlockchain :\\n\\nOWN is being built on Polygon for its near Instant transaction speed and negligible fees.

       "  \"What's in a NFT Mystery Box? 🤔🎁\",\n",
       "  \"If you are an active video gamer, you have probably met such a thing as [loot boxes](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what's-a-nft-mystery-box?utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=education_post). In games, they are found in various incarnations: eggs, chests, card boosters, etc. The essence of loot boxes is as follows — the player buys a box and receives a random reward: skins, weapons, unique features, clothes, or a character. This system is very popular among video game developers because it introduces a certain element of excitement for users and allows developers to earn additional income.\\n\\nWith the development of blockchain gaming and the introduction of NFTs, the loot boxes were modified and received a new name — [NFT mystery boxes](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what's-a-nft-mystery-box?utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=education_post). However, it is worth noting that NFT mystery boxes are not limited only to blockchain games, many of them include digital art objects. Thus, by opening an NFT mystery box, the user receives an NFT from a specific collection. It is logical to ask, “Why buy a mystery box if I can just buy NFT?”. Well, by opening the box, you never know which NFT you will come across. You pay a set amount, open the box in excitement, and get a random NFT. This can be either a common and inexpensive NFT or a super rare NFT sold for a jaw-dropping amount. The opportunity to get something scarce for a relatively low price makes NFT boxes so desirable.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8ira8oe1ux81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fd8fdc98b9b212c700f26d896f9cfd18e9ffd04\\n\\nAgainst the background of the NFT boom, many projects began to produce mystery boxes. For example, game projects like Axie Infinity or Metamon released boxes in which users can use various in-game assets — skins, weapons, land, characters, and so on. Other projects allow users to get unique digital art objects presented in the form of NFT. In addition, users can purchase a mystery box and become the happy owner of a unique melody.\\n\\n### How To Buy A Mystery Box?\\n\\nYou can try your luck and buy your first mystical box on open marketplaces — Binance NFT, OpenSea, Rarible, and others like them. It’s great if it turns out to buy out the NFT box faster than the rest, and they buy them up very quickly. Otherwise, the NFT mystery box owner can put it up for sale or auction at a much higher price.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16m4cwdj1ux81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=da8fa85e384e87c88b6c9ad34fbe8ff71008f619\\n\\nOften, by opening the description of the mystery box, you can get an idea of the items that you can get by opening the box, as well as the percentage probability of getting a specific item.\\n\\nIn order to buy an NFT mystery box, you need to choose a marketplace. Keep in mind that boxes are sold out very quickly on popular marketplaces, so the chance to get it at the initial price is minimal. Buying a box from other users, you either pay a fixed amount or participate in an auction and place bids.\\n\\nDepending on the specific marketplace, the instructions may vary slightly, but in general, it is as follows:\\n\\n1. Create or log in to your account.\\n2. Connect a supported wallet.\\n3. Select the [NFT mystery box](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what's-a-nft-mystery-box?utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=education_post).\\n4. Open the product page and read the description of the box.\\n5. Buy an NFT box or place a bid if it is being sold in the auction mode.\\n\\nAfter receiving your new mystery box, you can open it or put it up for sale. Moreover, you can open it and put it up for sale.\\xa0\\n\\nRead the full article through the link - [https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what's-a-nft-mystery-box?utm\\\\_source=social&utm\\\\_medium=twitter&utm\\\\_campaign=education\\\\_post](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what's-a-nft-mystery-box?utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=education_post)\"),\n",

At first, I didn’t understand the concept, but when I finally did, I realized that Authorzd is out to totally disrupt the future of the blockchain and crypto industry as well as usher in the golden age of NFTs.\\n\\nBeing one of the very few credible NFT platforms embracing the new concept of linking digital assets with physical products, one would be tempted to think that Authorzd may be a bit unreliable. I’m here to report that this is not the case with this particular platform. Transactions are fast and actually getting to purchase an NFT is a straight-forward process.\\n\\nTo acquire an NFT on Authorzd, you pay for a snapback as the physical product, and then you get a virtual trading card that has a unique QR on its backside. You scan the code to reveal your NFT. I was impressed by the fact that once you scan the QR code and retrieve the NFT, the asset is automatically added to the OpenSea NFT gallery.\\n\\nAnother fact is that the quality of the availed physical products is top-notch. The snapbacks are absolutely beautiful. Authorzd also offers great treats for early entrants. These may be in the form of tip-offs when there are high-potential products to invest in. If you’re one of the early community members, you also get priority treatment during early-stage sales of potentially lucrative digital products.\\n\\nBesides that, the NFT platform has plans to later introduce more off-line assets to back NFTs, and the same rules will apply. For now, 150 Blockhead Buddy NFTs and their corresponding real-world assets will be released, with the buying priority going to the early entrants.   \\n\\n\\nFor more about us, visit us on our:\\n\\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/BlockheadBuddyP](https://twitter.com/BlockheadBuddyP) \\n\\nWebsite [https://authorzd.com/](https://authorzd.com/)'),\n",

I’m here to report that this is not the case with this particular platform. Transactions are fast and actually getting to purchase an NFT is a straight-forward process.\\n\\nTo acquire an NFT on Authorzd, you pay for a snapback as the physical product, and then you get a virtual trading card that has a unique QR on its backside. You scan the code to reveal your NFT. I was impressed by the fact that once you scan the QR code and retrieve the NFT, the asset is automatically added to the OpenSea NFT gallery.\\n\\nAnother fact is that the quality of the availed physical products is top-notch. The snapbacks are absolutely beautiful. Authorzd also offers great treats for early entrants. These may be in the form of tip-offs when there are high-potential products to invest in. If you’re one of the early community members, you also get priority treatment during early-stage sales of potentially lucrative digital products.\\n\\nBesides that, the NFT platform has plans to later introduce more off-line assets to back NFTs, and the same rules will apply.

They have a team of 40 doxxed devs who do all their coding in house (per their social media). \\n\\n**What does RairTech do?** \\n\\nRair provides utility for NFTs that has never been seen before. If you’re like me, you constantly see new NFT drops that contain nothing more than a blockchain photo. It’s because if this that a lot of people call NFTs a “bubble”. However, **this company is allowing encrypted streaming of anything from video to music and even video games.** If big projects get on board with this… the future is limitless for what can be done. \\n\\n**The NFTs**\\nRairTech gifted me a limited edition project NFT for simply joining their socials. They plan on adding gaming and exclusive videos to their NFTs. It’s definitely worth a look!\\n\\n**Check out their NFT project**\\n\\nhttps://rair.tech\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/rairtech\\n\\n**Note, I have no affiliation with RAIRTECH, I just uncover what I find to the world**'),\n",

       "  ' I\\'ve released a new NFT collection on Opensea called \"Guest List Gallery.\"  Each personally made piece of NFT art gives the buyers the opportunity to have a say in the projects steps to reaching the goal in becoming one of the more valuable NFT\\'s out there; and honestly being a part of what I believe is the first NFT project to implement revenue for both the holders and myself being the creator of the project.  To make the utility side of things short and sweet, once the NFT is purchased I would implement the artwork into apparel which would be sold on Amazon to expose it obviously to a larger market to increase brand awareness leading to sales on my own personal website and basically go from whatever the outcome may be depending on sales. The NFT\\'s are I would for sure say listed way above average price of basically an unknown NFT collection; but the owner of each specific piece of artwork gets 40% of each apparel sale.  Would love to get some feedback on what I\\'ve already listed on opensea; again collection is linked created over 200 pieces of personal art which I\\'ve attached a few images along with my cute little rant. Let me know if you have any thoughts, suggestions or if interested in purchasing\\n\\n[Guest List Gallery](https://preview.redd.it/zzop1erekhx81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c3c8bb649fea5a132d2cc80b6a1171a13d921d)\\n\\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/uiarf7)'),\n",
