    "The market of non-fungible tokens, or NFT's for short, has boomed over the past two years, with interest and trading at an all-time high. Although the hype cannot last forever, the effects of NFT's on cryptocurrency as a whole should not be dismissed. The most popular and most expensive NFT collections are generally based on the Ethereum blockchain, mainly through Polygon on OpensSea, but marketplaces on other blockchains now exist for the trading and minting of NFT's, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Decentraland, and others. With this in mind, we aim to trade various cryptocurrencies, from large to small-cap, which are directly or indirectly related to the trading of NFT's, on signals produced from NFT data, such as number of sales, active wallets, buyers, and sales in USD, as well as sentiment and polarity data of text posts related to NFT's. We presume that NFT related data correlates well with our chosen universe of cryptocurrencies, which should allow for an effective trading strategy.  "

    "Online sentiment about NFT's, and cryptocurrency in general, may contribute to a lot of the hype around the trading of these assets. Some notable places for discussions include Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and Discord. For our collection of posts related to NFT's, we choose Reddit, specifically the r/NFT subreddit where many different NFT posts are made per day. This subreddit was created in 2016, but has historical posts dating back only to 2019, which does not affect our analysis.\n",

    "To collect the posts from Reddit, the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) and the Pushshift API Wrapper (PSAW) libraries are used. PSAW is only used due to the 1000 post limit per API call, and the inability to use date ranges to request posts, of the base Reddit API. Using these two libraries, around 300,000 posts from the r/NFT subreddit, from 2019 to 2022, are collected. For analysis, we only collect main posts and not comments or reply trees. These main posts usually do not have any text apart from their title, since most of them are memes, pictures, or other media related to NFT's. Due to this, the title of each post, as well as any post text that exists, are combined for each post and used for seniment analysis.\n",

    "The trading algorithm for our universe is based on predicted forward returns of one day. To predict these returns, we will use a regression model with the previously described NFT features, as well as some general technical indicators for the close prices of our instruments. These indicators are the RSI, Bollinger Bands (high and low), Average True Rate, and MACD (technical factor methods referenced from *Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading*, Chapter 7). Three simple models are chosen for comparison and evaluation of the predicted returns: OLS, random forest, and XGBoost. All three models are trained on the same input features, which include the technical indicators and the NFT features. No hyperparameters are changed, and the input features are not scaled or normalized. In total, there are 17 input features: 5 technical features, 10 quantitative NFT features, and 2 sentiment NFT features. The target variable are the one-day forward returns of the close price of each coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three models are all trained separately on each coin rather than all at once on the multi-indexed dataframe, due to issues with accurately setting the date range of the training, testing, and backtesting data. The feature importance and coefficients of the models are also calculated and visualized in the figures below. It seems that all three models use some or all of the quantitative NFT features, but the sentiment is only used slightly in the OLS model. The technical indicators do make up a bulk of the feature importance.\n",

    "There is a wealth of performance statistics which most professional fund managers would use to analyze the performance of the algorithm. These metrics range from the algorithm's annual and monthly returns, return quantiles, rolling beta and sharpe ratios to the turnover of the portfolio. The most critical metrics are discussed as follows.\n",
    "### Sharpe ratio\n",
    "The risk-adjusted return is an essential metric of any strategy. Risk-adjusted returns allow us to judge returns streams that have different individual volatilities by providing an avenue for meaningful comparison. There are different measures of risk-adjusted returns but one of the most popular is the Sharpe ratio. Sharpe ratios above 1.0 are generally considered \"good\", as this would suggest that the portfolio is offering excess returns relative to its volatility. Having said that, investors will often compare the Sharpe ratio of a portfolio relative to its peers. Therefore, a portfolio with a Sharpe ratio of 1.0 might be considered inadequate if the competitors in its peer group have an average Sharpe ratio above 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sharpe Ratio of the backtest is 1.296.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Market beta\n",
    "The market beta of an algorithm is the exposure of that stategy to the broader market. For instance, a market beta of 1 would mean that you're buying the the market, while a beta of -1 means that you are shorting the market. Any beta within this range signifies reduced market influence, while any beta outside this range signifies increased market influence. A coin that swings more than the market over time has a beta above 1.0. If a coin moves less than the market, the stock's beta is less than 1.0. High-beta stocks are supposed to be riskier but provide higher return potential; low-beta coins pose less risk but also lower returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The market beta of the backtest is 0.014.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawdown\n",
    "Drawdowns are important for measuring the historical risk of different investments, comparing fund performance, or monitoring personal trading performance.A drawdown refers to how much an investment or trading account is down from the peak before it recovers back to the peak. Drawdowns are typically quoted as a percentage, but dollar terms may also be used if applicable for a specific trader.They are a measure of downside volatility. The time it takes to recover a drawdown should also be considered when assessing drawdowns. A drawdown and loss aren't necessarily the same thing. Most traders view a drawdown as a peak-to-trough metric, while losses typically refer to the purchase price relative to the current or exit price. This is another measure of the financial risk of an algorithm. If the net drawdown of a strategy is very significant, this generally means that the volatility of the algorithm is more significant. Good strategies try to limit drawdowns. A good benchmark is to have a maximum drawdown of less than 20%.\n",

    "The center line in the middle of each box shows the median return, and the box shows the first quartile (25th percentile) as well as the 3rd quartile (75th percentile). While a high median return is always helpful, it is also important to understand the returns distribution. A tight box means that the bulk of the returns (25th - 75th percentile) fall within a tight bound - i.e. the returns are consistent and not volatile. A larger box means that the returns are more spread out. It is important, however, to take note of the scale to the left to put the quartiles in perspective. In addition, returns over longer periods of time will have a wider distribution as increasing the length of time increases the variability in returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'whiskers' at the end indicate the returns which fall outside the 25th and 75th percentile. A tight box with long whiskers indicate that there may be outliers in the returns - which may not be ideal if the outliers are negative. This may indicate that your strategy may be susceptible to certain market conditions / time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have several rolling plots which show how an estimate changes throughout backtest period. In the case of the rolling beta and the rolling Sharpe ratio, the rolling estimate gives us more information than single point estimate for the entire period. A rolling estimate allows the user to see if the risk-adjusted return of the algorithm (Sharpe ratio) is consistent over time or if it fluctuates significantly. A volatile Sharpe ratio may indicate that the strategy may be riskier at certain time points or that it does not perform as well at these time points. Likewise, a volatile rolling beta indicates that it is exposed to the market during certain time points - if the strategy is meant to be market neutral, this could be a red flag.\n",
    "### Rolling Beta Plot\n",
    "The plot below shows the rolling beta of the strategy against benchmark returns over the entire period of the backtest. In this instance, the benchmark return of the AMI was used. Thus, the lower the rolling portfolio beta to the AMI, the more market neutral an algorithm is.\n",

    "### Top Positions\n",
    "The tables below list the top 10 long and short positions of all time. The goal of each algorithm is to minimize the proportion of the portfolio invested in each security at any time point. This prevents the movement of any individual security from having a significant impact on the portfolio as a whole. The bigger the exposure a strategy has to any security, the greater the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the biggest failure point for many strategies is high portfolio concentration in a few securities. While this may produce significant positive returns over a given time period, the converse can easily occur. Huge swings in a small number of equities would result in significant drawdowns. Good strategies tend to be those in which no security comprises more than 10% of the portfolio.\n",

    "The holdings per day allows us to gain an insight into whether the total portfolio holdings fluctuate from day to day. This plot provides a good sanity check as to whether the algorithm is performing as it should, or if there were any bugs which should be fixed. For instance, we can use to holdings plot to check if the trading behavior is expected, i.e. if there are extended periods in which the number of holdings is exceptionally low or if that the algorithm is not trading.\n",
    "![holding](figures/performance_evaluation/holding.png)\n",
    "## Daily Turnover\n",
    "This plot reflects how many coins are traded as a fraction of total coins. The higher the daily turnover, the higher the transaction costs associated with the algorithm. However, this also means that the returns and risk metrics are better able to capture the underlying performance of the algorithm as the higher quantity of trades provides more samples (of returns, risk, etc.) to draw from. This would in turn give a better estimation on Out of Sample periods as well. Likewise, the Daily Turnover Histogram gives you an overview of the distribution of the turnover of your portfolio. This shows you both the average daily turnover of your portfolio and any outlier trading days.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "NFTs is a relatively new concept in the finance world. We utilized information regarding NFTs to inform our decisions in trading. Both quantitive and alternative data have been used to render features for or Machine Learning models. The Machine learning models predicted the next day's future returns, which have been used to create long and short signals. The period which the algorithmic strategy was backtested on, is a period which the market is going down. This can be observed by observing the cumulative returns of buying and holding the AMI index. This strategy was used as a benchmark to compare the algorithmic strategy against. For that in-sample and out of sample period, our algorithm yielded us significant returns, while the AMI index was predominantly depreciating in value. "
